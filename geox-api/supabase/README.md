Supabase Scripts
----------------

Our support tickets and our mailing list (formerly waitlist) use Supabase.

I don't yet know the proper way to ensure that our work on Supabase ends up in version control,
but since the text is important, this folder will have the "database migrations" for Supabase
as a series of SQL scripts.
