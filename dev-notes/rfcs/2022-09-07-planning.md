====================

- Task management
  - Notion + Github
  - TODO migrate this doc to Notion
- Ensuring that master does not break
  - Staging?
  - E2E tests using Cypress / Puppeteer?
- How to do organizations?
  - Ultimate goal:
    - Google Docs-style sharing of maps
  - First iteration: Manual onboarding for enterprise
    - We add users (or the email domains) to the Auth0 whitelist
    - We tell users to sign up
    - We manually generate organizations
    - We manually assign users to the organization
      and deactivate all other memberships in Postgres
      (script for this in the `analysis` directory)
  - Second iteration: Domain-based or Auth0 app metatada-based approach
      - Email domain-based approach
        - We manually add email domain to the organizations table
        - We create organizations based on email address
        - If a user signs up with a particular email domain,
          we push them into the organization with that domain
        - If you are not in an organization at the time of sign-up,
          you will end up in a "personal" workspace
	- Issues:
	  - This is some amount of manual work for what seems like a boilerplate exercise
      - App metadata in Auth0 approach
        - Push organization into app metadata in the JWT
	- We read the organization from the app metadata in the JWT
	- Unknowns:
	  - How do we get the organization into the app metadata?
- Snowflake external data shares
  - Celery task is here: https://github.com/mercatorhq/mercator/blob/master/geox-api/app/worker.py
  - [ ] Do this automatically: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-external-s3.html
        and maybe this, https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-table.html
  - [X] Configure a view for an organization on Snowflake
  - [ ] Share that to an external Snowflake organization
    - Docs for [setting up a snowflake data share](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-gs.html#step-1-create-a-share)
    - Also this: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro.html
