### Progress
- Use Monaco Editor, mostly for auto-complete and syntax highlighting

### Plans
- Errors should not catastrophically crash the Python UI. How do I do error handling? Starboard has this figured out.
- Editor height should better fit the number of lines

### Observations
- [CodeMirror](https://uiwjs.github.io/react-codemirror/) might be a lighter weight alternative
- Market has: PyScript, Steamlit, ReTool, Anvil, Iodide (RIP), Pyodide, Jupyter, Starboard
