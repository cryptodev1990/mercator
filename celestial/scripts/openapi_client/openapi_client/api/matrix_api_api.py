We also integrated other network data providers. This chapter gives an overview about the options you have.  ## OpenStreetMap  #### Geographical Coverage  [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) covers the whole world. If you want to see for yourself if we can provide data suitable for your region, please visit [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/). You can edit and modify OpenStreetMap data if you find that important information is missing, e.g. a weight limit for a bridge. [Here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide) is a beginner's guide that shows how to add data. If you have edited data, we usually consider your data after 1 week at the latest.  #### Supported Routing Profiles  The Routing, Matrix and Route Optimization APIs support the following profiles:  Name             | Description           | Restrictions                        | Icon -----------------|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------- car              | Car mode              | car access, weight=2500kg, width=2m, height=2m           | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png) car_delivery     | Car mode              | car access including delivery and private roads | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png) car_avoid_ferry      | Car mode          | car that heavily penalizes ferries          | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png) car_avoid_motorway   | Car mode          | car that heavily penalizes motorways        | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png) car_avoid_toll       | Car mode          | car that heavily penalizes tolls            | ![car image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/car.png) small_truck          | Small truck like a Mercedes Sprinter, Ford Transit or Iveco Daily | height=2.7m, width=2+0.34m, length=5.5m, weight=2080+1400 kg | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png) small_truck_delivery | Small truck                                             | like small_truck but including delivery and private roads             | ![small truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/small_truck.png) truck                  | Truck like a MAN or Mercedes-Benz Actros              | height=3.7m, width=2.6+0.34m, length=12m, weight=13000+13000 kg, hgv=yes, 3 Axes | ![truck image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/truck.png) scooter                | Moped mode | Fast inner city, often used for food delivery, is able to ignore certain bollards, maximum speed of roughly 50km/h. weight=300kg, width=1m, height=2m | ![scooter image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/scooter.png) scooter_delivery       | Moped mode | Like scooter but including delivery and private roads | ![scooter image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/scooter.png)     foot       | Pedestrian or walking without dangerous [SAC-scales](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:sac_scale) | foot access         | ![foot image](https://graphhopper.com/maps/img/foot.png) hike       | Pedestrian or walking with priority for more beautiful hiking tours and potentially a bit longer than `foot`.

There are three JSON properties to change a profile: `priority`, `speed` and `distance_influence` that are described in great detail in the next sections.  But first we will give an introductory example for each of these JSON properties. Let's start with `speed`:  ```json {   \"speed\": [{     \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",     \"limit_to\": 90   }] } ```  As you might have already guessed this limits the speed on motorways to 90km/h. Changing the speed will of course change the travel time, but at the same time this makes other road classes more likely as well, so you can use this model to avoid motorways.  You can immediately try this out in the Browser [on GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=50.856527%2C12.876127&point=51.02952%2C13.295603&profile=car&custom_model=%7B%22speed%22%3A%5B%7B%22if%22%3A%22road_class+=%3D+MOTORWAY%22%2C%22limit_to%22%3A90%7D%5D%7D). GraphHopper Maps offers an interactive text editor to comfortably enter custom models. You can open it by pressing the \"custom\" button. It will check the syntax of your custom model and mark errors in red. You can press Ctrl+Space or Alt+Enter to retrieve auto-complete suggestions. Pressing Ctrl+Enter will send a routing request for the custom model you entered. To disable the custom model you click the \"custom\" button again.   In the second example we show how to avoid certain road classes without changing the travel time:  ```json {   \"priority\": [{     \"if\": \"road_class == LIVING_STREET || road_class == RESIDENTIAL || road_class == UNCLASSIFIED\",     \"multiply_by\": 0.1   }] } ```  This example avoids certain smaller streets. [View it in GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=51.125708%2C13.067915&point=51.125964%2C13.082271&profile=car&custom_model=%7B%22priority%22%3A%5B%7B%22if%22%3A%22road_class+=%3D+LIVING_STREET+%7C%7C+road_class+%3D%3D+RESIDENTIAL+%7C%7C+road_class+%3D%3D+UNCLASSIFIED%22%2C%22multiply_by%22%3A0.1%7D%5D%7D).  The third example shows how to prefer shortest paths:  ```json {   \"distance_influence\": 200 } ```  [View this example in GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=51.04188%2C13.057766&point=51.057527%2C13.068237&profile=car&custom_model=%7B%22distance_influence%22%3A200%7D).  There is a fourth JSON property `areas` that allows you to define areas that can then be used in the `if` or `else_if` conditions for `speed` and `priority`. Please read more about this and the other properties below and try some examples in [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/) with the help of [this blog post](https://www.graphhopper.com/blog/2020/05/31/examples-for-customizable-routing/).   ## Customizing speed  When using custom models you do not need to define rules that specify a speed for every road segment, but rather GraphHopper assumes a default speed. All you need to do is adjust this default speed to your use-case as you will always use the custom  model in conjunction with a routing profile which is used to determine the default speed.  The custom model is a JSON object and the first property we will learn about here is the `speed` property. The `speed` property's value is a list of conditional statements that modify the default speed. Every such statement consists of a condition and an operation. The different statements are applied to the default speed from top to bottom, i.e. statements that come later in the list are applied to the resulting value of previous operations. Each statement is only executed if the corresponding condition applies for the current road segment. This will become more clear in the following examples.  Currently the custom model language supports two operators:  - `multiply_by` multiplies the speed value with a given number - `limit_to` limits the speed value to a given number  #### `if` statements and the `multiply_by` operation  Let's start with a simple example using `multiply_by`:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.5     }   ] } ```  This custom model reduces the speed of every road segment for which the `road_class` attribute is `MOTORWAY` to fifty percent of the default speed (the default speed is multiplied by `0.5`). Again, the default speed is the speed that GraphHopper would normally use for the profile's vehicle. Note the `if` clause which means that the operation (`multiply_by`) is only applied *if* the condition `road_class == MOTORWAY` is fulfilled for the road segment under consideration. The `==` indicates equality, i.e. the condition reads \"the road_class equals MOTORWAY\". If you're a bit familiar with programming note that the condition (the value of the `if` key) is just a boolean condition in Java language (other programming languages like C or JavaScript are very similar in this regard). A more complex condition could look like this: `road_class == PRIMARY || road_class == TERTIARY` which uses the **or** (`||`) operator and literally means \"road_class equals PRIMARY or road_class equals TERTIARY\".  There can be multiple such 'if statements' in the speed section, and they are evaluated from top to bottom:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.5     },     {       \"if\": \"road_class == PRIMARY || road_environment == TUNNEL\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.7     }   ] } ```  In this example the default speed of road segments with `road_class == MOTORWAY` will be multiplied by `0.5`, the default speed of road segments with `road_class == PRIMARY` will be multiplied by `0.7` and for road segments with both `road_class == MOTORWAY` and `road_environment == TUNNEL` the default speed will be multiplied first by `0.5` and then by `0.7`. So overall the default speed will be multiplied by `0.35`. For road segments with `road_class == PRIMARY` and `road_environment == TUNNEL` we only multiply by `0.7`, even though both parts of the second condition apply. It only matters whether the road segment matches the condition or not.  `road_class` and `road_environment` are road attributes of 'enum' type, i.e. their value can only be one of a fixed set of values, like `MOTORWAY` for `road_class`.  Other road attributes like `get_off_bike` are of `boolean` type. They can be used as conditions directly, for example:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"get_off_bike\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.6     }   ] } ```  which means that for road segments with `get_off_bike==true` the speed factor will be `0.6`.  For attributes with numeric values, like `max_width` you should not use the `==` (equality) or `!=` ( inequality) operators, but the numerical comparison operators \"bigger\" `>`, \"bigger or equals\" `>=`, \"smaller\" `<`, or \"smaller or equals\" `<=`, e.g.:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"max_width < 2.5\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.8     }   ] } ```   which means that for all road segments with `max_width` smaller than `2.5m` the speed is multiplied by `0.8`.   ### The `limit_to` operation  Besides the `multiply_by` operator there is also the `limit_to` operator. As the name suggests `limit_to` limits the current value to the given value. Take this example:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.8     },     {       \"if\": \"surface == GRAVEL\",       \"limit_to\": 60     }   ] } ```  This implies that on all road segments with the `GRAVEL` value for `surface` the speed will be at most `60km/h`, regardless of the default speed and the previous rules. So for a road segment with `road_class == MOTORWAY`, `surface == GRAVEL` and default speed `100` the first statement reduces the speed from `100` to `80` and the second statement further reduces the speed from `80` to `60`. If the `road_class` was `PRIMARY` and the default speed was `50` the first rule would not apply and the second rule would do nothing, because limiting `50` to `60` still yields `50`.  Note that all values used for `limit_to` must be in the range `[0, max_vehicle_speed]` where `max_vehicle_speed` is the maximum speed that is set for the base vehicle and cannot be changed.  A common use-case for the `limit_to` operation is the following pattern:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"true\",       \"limit_to\": 90     }   ] } ```  which means that the speed is limited to `90km/h` for all road segments regardless of its properties. The condition \"`true`\" is always fulfilled.  ### `else` and `else_if` statements  The `else` statement allows you to define that some operations should be applied if an road segment does **not** match a condition. So this example:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.5     },     {       \"else\": \"\",       \"limit_to\": 50     }   ] } ```  means that for all road segments with `road_class == MOTORWAY` we multiply the default speed by `0.5` and for all others we limit the default speed to `50` (but never both).  In case you want to distinguish more than two cases (road segments that match or match not a condition) you can use `else_if` statements which are only evaluated in case the previous `if` or `else_if` statement did **not** match:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.5     },     {       \"else_if\": \"road_environment == TUNNEL\",       \"limit_to\": 70     },     {       \"else\": \"\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.9     }   ] } ```  So if the first condition matches (`road_class == MOTORWAY`) the default speed is multiplied by `0.5`, but the other two statements are ignored. Only if the first statement does not match (e.g. `road_class == PRIMARY`) the second statement is even considered and only if it matches (`road_environment == TUNNEL`) the default speed is limited to 70. The last operation (`multiply_by: 0.9`) is only applied if both previous conditions did not match.  `else` and `else_if` statements always require a preceding `if` or `else_if` statement. However, there can be multiple 'blocks' of subsequent `if/else_if/else` statements in the list of rules for `speed`.  `else_if` is useful for example in case you have multiple `multiply_by` operations, but you do not want that the speed gets reduced by all of them. For the following model  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.5     },     {       \"else_if\": \"road_environment == TUNNEL\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.8     }   ] } ```  only the first factor (`0.5`) will be applied even for road segments that fulfill both conditions.  ## Limit rules to certain areas  You can not only modify the speed of road segments based on properties, like we saw in the previous examples, but you can also modify the speed of road segments based on their location. To do this you need to first create and add some areas to the `areas` section of the custom model. You can then use the name of these areas in the conditions of your `if/else/else_if` statements.  In the following example we multiply the speed of all road segments in an area called `custom1` with `0.7` and also limit it to `50km/h`. Note that each area's name needs to be prefixed with `in_`:  ```json {   \"speed\": [     {       \"if\": \"in_custom1\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.7     },     {       \"if\": \"in_custom1\",       \"limit_to\": 50     }   ],   \"areas\": {     \"custom1\": {       \"type\": \"Feature\",       \"id\": \"something\",       \"properties\": {},       \"geometry\": {         \"type\": \"Polygon\",         \"coordinates\": [           [             [               1.525,               42.511             ],             [               1.510,               42.503             ],             [               1.531,               42.495             ],             [               1.542,               42.505             ],             [               1.525,               42.511             ]           ]         ]       }     }   } } ```  Areas are given in GeoJson format, but currently only the exact format in the above example is supported, i.e. one object with type `Feature`, a geometry with type `Polygon` and optional (but ignored) `id` and `properties` fields. Note that the coordinates array of `Polygon` is an array of arrays that each must describe a closed ring, i.e. the first point must be equal to the last. Each point is given as an array [longitude, latitude], so the coordinates array has three dimensions total.  Using the `areas` feature you can also block entire areas i.e. by multiplying the speed with `0`, but for this you should rather use the `priority` section that we will explain next.  ## Customizing priority  Make sure you read the introductory section of this document to learn what the `priority` factor means. In short it allows similar modifications as `speed`, but instead of modifying the road segment weights *and* travel times it will only affect the weights. By default, the priority is `1` for every road segment, so it does not affect the weight. However, changing the priority of a road can yield a relative weight difference in comparison to other roads.  Customizing the `priority` works very much like changing the `speed`, so in case you did not read the section about `speed` you should go back there and read it now. The only real difference is that there is no `limit_to` operator for `priority`. As a quick reminder here is an example for priority:  ```json {   \"priority\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.5     },     {       \"else_if\": \"road_class == SECONDARY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.9     },     {       \"if\": \"road_environment == TUNNEL\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.1     }   ] } ```  means that road segments with `road_class==MOTORWAY` and `road_environment==TUNNEL` get priority `0.5*0.1=0.05` and those with `road_class==SECONDARY` and no TUNNEL, get priority `0.9` and so on.  Edges with lower priority values will be less likely part of the optimal route calculated by GraphHopper, higher values mean that these road segments shall be preferred. If you do not want to state which road segments shall be avoided, but rather which ones shall be preferred, you need to **decrease** the priority of others:  ```json {   \"priority\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class != CYCLEWAY\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.8     }   ] } ```  means decreasing the priority for all road_classes *except* cycleways.  Just like we saw for `speed` you can also adjust the priority for road segments in a certain area. It works exactly the same way:  ```json {   \"priority\": [     {       \"if\": \"in_custom1\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.7     }   ] } ```  To block an entire area set the priority value to `0`. You can even set the priority only for certain roads in an area like this:  ```json {   \"priority\": [     {       \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY && in_custom1\",       \"multiply_by\": 0.1     }   ] } ```  Some other useful attributes to restrict access to certain roads depending on your vehicle dimensions are the following:  ```json {   \"priority\": [     {       \"if\": \"max_width < 2.5\",       \"multiply_by\": 0     },     {       \"if\": \"max_length < 10\",       \"multiply_by\": 0     },     {       \"if\": \"max_weight < 3.5\",       \"multiply_by\": 0     }   ] } ```  which means that the priority for all road segments that allow a maximum vehicle width of `2.5m`, a maximum vehicle length of `10m` or a maximum vehicle weight of `3.5tons`, or less, is zero, i.e. these \"narrow\" road segments are blocked.  ## Customizing distance_influence  The `distance_influence` property allows you to control the trade-off between a fast route (minimum time) and a short route (minimum distance). The larger `distance_influence` is the more GraphHopper will prioritize routes with a small total distance. More precisely, the `distance_influence` is the time you need to save on a detour (a longer distance route option) such that you prefer taking the detour compared to a shorter route.   A value of `100` means that one extra kilometer of detour must save you `100s` of travelling time or else you are not  willing to take the detour. Or to put it another way, if a reference route takes `600s` and is `10km` long,  `distance_influence=100` means that you are willing to take an alternative route that is `11km` long only if  it takes no longer than `500s` (saves `100s`). Things get a bit more complicated when `priority` is not `1`, but the  effect stays the same: The larger `distance_influence` is, the more GraphHopper will focus on finding short routes.   ## Road attributes  GraphHopper stores different attributes for every road segment. Some frequently used are the following (some of their possible values are given in brackets):  - road_class: (OTHER, MOTORWAY, TRUNK, PRIMARY, SECONDARY, TRACK, STEPS, CYCLEWAY, FOOTWAY, ...) - road_environment: (ROAD, FERRY, BRIDGE, TUNNEL, ...) - road_access: (DESTINATION, DELIVERY, PRIVATE, NO, ...) - surface: (PAVED, DIRT, SAND, GRAVEL, ...) - smoothness: (EXCELLENT, GOOD, INTERMEDIATE, ...) - toll: (NO, ALL, HGV)  To learn about all available attributes you can query the `/info` endpoint or use auto complete in GraphHopper Maps.  Besides these road attributes, which can take distinct string values, there are also some that represent a boolean value (they are either true or false for a given road segment), like:  - get_off_bike - road_class_link  There are also some that take on a numeric value, like:  - max_weight - max_height - max_width  ## Limitations  Custom models are currently:  1. only available for the [POST Route Endpoint](#operation/postRoute). If you are interested in using this for the Matrix or Route Optimization API please [contact us](https://www.graphhopper.com/contact-form/) to get access to an early alpha version. For the Isochrone API it is also planned. 2. only available for the following parent profiles: `foot`, `bike`, `scooter`, `car` and `small_truck`. 3. only available for OpenStreetMap.  This feature will strongly benefit from feedback, so do not hesitate to share your experience, your favorite custom model or some of the problems you ran into when you tried building your own with custom model.  ## Troubleshooting  ### Recommendations  For debugging you can use the custom model editor in [GraphHopper Maps](https://graphhopper.com/maps/) (click the 'custom' button).  When debugging problems with custom models you should first try if your request goes through without an error using an empty custom model.  For production you should avoid to include road_access and toll in the profile as we will change their values in the next weeks which could cause unexpected problems.  ### All routes for my custom model fail  This could mean that either your custom model made some of the roads near the start and destination inaccessible,  then usually we return a PointNotFoundException with the point_index with the \"location snap\" problem.  Or, the custom model made all roads between your start and destination inaccessible, then we return a ConnectionNotFoundException. This happens e.g. when you exclude tunnels,  ferries or motorways but all routes between start and destination have these road attributes satisfied, i.e. we cannot find a route.  **Solution**: relax your custom model and e.g. instead of excluding certain road attributes via `\"multiply_by\": 0` you should try to use `0.01`.   # noqa: E501

        Prefer the [synchronous endpoint](#operation/postMatrix) and use this Batch endpoint for long running problems only.  The Batch Matrix endpoint allows using matrices with more locations and works asynchronously - similar to the [Batch Route Optimization endpoint](#operation/asyncVRP):  * Create a HTTP POST request against `/matrix/calculate` and add the key in the URL: `/matrix/calculate?key=[YOUR_KEY]`. This will give you the `job_id` from the response json like `{ \"job_id\": \"7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097\" }`  * Poll via HTTP GET requests every 500ms against `/matrix/solution/[job_id]`  Here are some full examples via curl: ```bash $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/calculate?key=[YOUR_KEY]\" -d '{\"points\":[[13.29895,52.48696],[13.370876,52.489575],[13.439026,52.511206]]}' {\"job_id\":\"7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097\"} ```  Pick the returned `job_id` and use it in the next GET requests: ```bash $ curl -X GET \"https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/solution/7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097?key=[YOUR_KEY]\" {\"status\":\"waiting\"} ```  When the calculation is finished (`status:finished`) the JSON response will contain the full matrix JSON under `solution`: ```bash $ curl -X GET \"https://graphhopper.com/api/1/matrix/solution/7ac65787-fb99-4e02-a832-2c3010c70097?key=[YOUR_KEY]\" {\"solution\":{\"weights\":[[0.0,470.453,945.414],[503.793,0.0,580.871],[970.49,569.511,0.0]],\"info\":{\"copyrights\":[\"GraphHopper\",\"OpenStreetMap contributors\"]}},\"status\":\"finished\"} ```  Please note that if an error occured while calculation the JSON will not have a status but contain directly the error message e.g.: ```json {\"message\":\"Cannot find from_points: 1\"} ``` And the optional `hints` array.   # noqa: E501

            profile (str): [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of "car"
            point ([str]): Specify multiple points in `latitude,longitude` for which the weight-, route-, time- or distance-matrix should be calculated. In this case the starts are identical to the destinations. If there are N points, then NxN entries will be calculated. The order of the point parameter is important. Specify at least three points. Cannot be used together with from_point or to_point.. [optional]
            from_point ([str]): The starting points for the routes in `latitude,longitude`. E.g. if you want to calculate the three routes A-&gt;1, A-&gt;2, A-&gt;3 then you have one from_point parameter and three to_point parameters.. [optional]
            to_point ([str]): The destination points for the routes in `latitude,longitude`.. [optional]
            point_hint ([str]): Optional parameter. Specifies a hint for each `point` parameter to prefer a certain street for the closest location lookup. E.g. if there is an address or house with two or more neighboring streets you can control for which street the closest location is looked up.. [optional]
            from_point_hint ([str]): For the from_point parameter. See point_hint. [optional]

Current supported values `motorway`, `trunk`, `ferry`, `tunnel`, `bridge` and `ford`. Multiple values are specified like `snap_prevention=ferry&snap_prevention=motorway`. Please note that this feature does not e.g. avoid motorways for the route - it only avoids it for the \"location snap\". . [optional]
            curbside ([str]): Optional parameter. It specifies on which side a point should be relative to the driver when she leaves/arrives at a start/target/via point. You need to specify this parameter for either none or all points. Only supported for motor vehicles and OpenStreetMap.. [optional]
            from_curbside ([str]): Curbside setting for the from_point parameter. See curbside.. [optional]
            to_curbside ([str]): Curbside setting for the to_point parameter. See curbside.. [optional]
            out_array ([str]): Specifies which arrays should be included in the response. Specify one or more of the following options 'weights', 'times', 'distances'. To specify more than one array use e.g. out_array=times&out_array=distances. The units of the entries of distances are meters, of times are seconds and of weights is arbitrary and it can differ for different vehicles or versions of this API.. [optional]
            fail_fast (bool): Specifies whether or not the matrix calculation should return with an error as soon as possible in case some points cannot be found or some points are not connected. If set to `false` the time/weight/distance matrix will be calculated for all valid points and contain the `null` value for all entries that could not be calculated.
